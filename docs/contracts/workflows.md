# Trading Copilot Workflow Contracts

This repository is a trading research workflow package for Codex/Claude/OpenClaw-style agents. It is not a broker, execution engine, or standalone trading product.

All workflows must preserve the repository safety rules:

- Never place real trades or call broker APIs.
- Do not output deterministic buy/sell instructions.
- Use scenarios, triggers, invalidation, risk, and `NO TRADE`.
- Use `knowledge/refined/` as the only rule source for trading conclusions.
- Fetch or prepare real market data before making current/recent symbol claims.

## Shared Status Envelope

Machine-callable workflows should return a JSON object with these fields:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "workflow": "pre-market-plan",
  "date": "2026-05-26",
  "artifacts": ["report/2026-05-26/pre-market-context.json"],
  "skipped": false,
  "reason": null
}
```

Field meanings:

- `status`: `success`, `skipped`, or `failed`.
- `workflow`: the canonical workflow name.
- `date`: the market/report date when the workflow can resolve one.
- `artifacts`: paths that were written or should be read next.
- `skipped`: `true` only when the workflow intentionally did not run.
- `reason`: skip or failure reason. Use `null` for a normal successful run.

## pre-market-plan

Purpose: prepare the context that a human-facing pre-market report agent will use.

Canonical command:

```bash
python3 script/trading_copilot.py pre-market-plan --watchlist config/watchlist.json --skip-non-trading-day
```

Inputs:

- `config/watchlist.json`
- Prior completed trading day's `report/<SNAPSHOT_DATE>/daily-snapshot.json`
- `knowledge/refined/`
- `agent/daily_analysis_prompt.md`

Deterministic script output:

- `report/<PRE_MARKET_DATE>/pre-market-context.json`

Agent report outputs:

- `report/<PRE_MARKET_DATE>/exec-brief.md`
- `report/<PRE_MARKET_DATE>/pre-market.md`

Skip behavior:

- If `--skip-non-trading-day` is set and the report date is not a regular US trading day, return `status=skipped`.
- If the required source snapshot is missing, return `status=failed` with the missing path in `reason`.

## post-market-review

Purpose: prepare the completed-market snapshot that a post-market review agent will use.

Canonical command:

```bash
python3 script/trading_copilot.py post-market-review --watchlist config/watchlist.json --skip-non-trading-day
```

Inputs:

- `config/watchlist.json`
- Twelve Data market data via `.env` or `TWELVE_DATA_API_KEY`
- Optional S&P 500 dynamic universe flags
- `knowledge/refined/`
- `agent/post_market_analysis_prompt.md`

Deterministic script outputs:

- `raw_data/<SNAPSHOT_DATE>/<INTERVAL>/<SYMBOL>.json`
- `report/<SNAPSHOT_DATE>/daily-snapshot.json`
- Optional `report/<SNAPSHOT_DATE>/candidate-universe.json`

Agent report output:

- `report/<SNAPSHOT_DATE>/post-market.md`

Skip behavior:

- If `--skip-non-trading-day` is set and the snapshot date is not a regular US trading day, return `status=skipped`.
- Per-symbol fetch failures should be recorded in the snapshot `errors` array instead of aborting the whole snapshot when possible.

## monitor-brief

Purpose: scan the active monitor state and produce a structured intraday observation artifact.

Canonical command:

```bash
python3 script/trading_copilot.py monitor-brief --state config/monitor_state.json --interval 5min
```

Inputs:

- `config/monitor_state.json` if present, otherwise the script default state
- Twelve Data intraday data via `.env` or `TWELVE_DATA_API_KEY`
- `knowledge/refined/`

Deterministic output:

- `report/latest-monitor.json`

Agent summary output:

- A concise monitor brief in the response or a user-requested report file.

Output rules:

- Treat statuses as observation states, not trade instructions.
- Include data freshness and rule limitations.
- Use `NO TRADE` when setup quality, data quality, or risk framing is insufficient.

## symbol-analysis

Purpose: perform an ad-hoc review of a single symbol.

Inputs:

- A symbol.
- A date or clearly stated analysis timestamp.
- The latest relevant snapshot/context artifact.
- Optional user-supplied position or thesis.
- `knowledge/refined/`.

Outputs:

- A symbol memo, either in the response or under `report/<DATE>/symbol-<SYMBOL>.md` when the user asks for a file.

Required sections:

- Data basis.
- Market context.
- Setup candidates.
- Bull/base/bear scenarios.
- Triggers and invalidation.
- Risk notes.
- `NO TRADE` when no rule-backed setup exists.

Boundary:

- Do not analyze current/recent prices without first preparing or reading real market data.

## research-note

Purpose: turn source material, market observations, or user questions into a reusable research note.

Inputs:

- User-provided topic or source path.
- Optional `knowledge/source/` material.
- `knowledge/refined/` for rule consistency checks.

Outputs:

- A research memo in the response or a user-requested file.

Boundary:

- Research notes do not automatically promote new trading rules.
- Rule promotion requires an explicit review task and should update `knowledge/refined/` only after checking conflicts.

## rule-check

Purpose: validate a user thesis, report section, or setup idea against the approved rule base.

Inputs:

- User-supplied thesis or artifact path.
- `knowledge/refined/global/`.
- Relevant `knowledge/refined/setups/` files.

Outputs:

- `pass`, `fail`, or `unclear` by rule area.
- Missing-data and missing-rule notes.
- Concrete edits needed to make the thesis compliant.

Boundary:

- Do not invent missing setup rules.
- Prefer `NO TRADE` when a thesis depends on unresolved rule conflicts.
